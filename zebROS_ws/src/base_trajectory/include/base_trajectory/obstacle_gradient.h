// This class creates an array of values correlated to an input
// cost map. The potential field represented it designed to add
// costs to the map for areas obstructed by an obstacle. Rather
// than just add a high cost for each grid map square containing
// an obstacle, this potential map creates a gradient of costs
// sloping away from the center of each obstacle. That way, the
// gradient descent optimizer will have a set of decreasing costs
// to follow to get out from the middle of an obstacle rather than
// seeing a uniform cost for any path through the obstacle.
