# Visualization for TagSLAM

This repository is useful for visualizing data produced by
[TagSLAM](https://github.com/berndpfrommer/tagslam), a package for
fiducial marker based SLAM.

## How to wrap a tag onto a mesh

[Here](docs/README_blender.md) is a cook book recipe on how to texture
a single surface with blender.

## How to generate mesh files

Use the ``convert_tags.bash`` in the src directory to mass convert
apriltags. Modify the script to process different families

## How to visualize tags

This package contains a python script that generates a urdf robot
model for the tags so  you can visualize in rviz. It works off of the
``positions.yaml`` file generated by TagSLAM:

    roslaunch tagslam_viz visualize_tags.launch tag_id_file:=$HOME/.ros/poses.yaml

See also the ``example_tag_id.yaml`` file in the ``config``
subdirecory.

## How to visualize cameras

Just like tags, you can visualize cameras:

    roslaunch tagslam_viz visualize_tags.launch cameras_file:=path_to_your_cameras_file.yaml

You can find an example cameras file in the ``config`` subdirectory.
